    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments in photon detection require producing a dim flash of light that is right at the limit of what is perceivable. A counter intuitive aspect of detection is that it's probabilistic.  For seemingly the same light intensity, sometimes the flash is seen and sometimes it's not.  What changes is the *probability* of seeing the flash.  The question is, where does this randomness come from?  Is it the inherent variability of biology?  Are there sources of noise?  Is the observer, perhaps unconsciously, adjusting their criterion?  Could it be in the light itself?  Like most things in biology, the answer is, in varying degrees, all of the above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model the process of photon detection, we first have to describe the stream of photons.  This stream is inherently random.  For a light source and for reflected light in the natural world, there isn't a highly precise clock emitting an exact number photons with femtosecond precision.  The photons are generated spontaneously, at controlled rates, and are independent of each other, which means that they arrive at random intervals.  If they didn't, they wouldn't be independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "A statistical description of this stream is called a **Poisson process**.  Of course at a longer time scale, the flash (or the shutter that produced the flash) introduces a dependency, but for periods within the duration of the flash, the photons are random.  Much of perception is about solving a probabilistic inverse problem, and it is useful (not to mention instructive) to be able to simulate stimuli from an idealized and controllable world where we can introduce complexity as necessary.  Knowing this \"ground truth\", we can then use this simulated data to test different perceptional models.\n"

    "\n",
    "We will simulate a stream of photons with a Poisson process, which can be modeled in two different ways.  One is to select the event times randomly, the other is to generate random intervals between the events.  When you run your code, run it multiple times (using control-enter in the jupyter notebook) to see that there is a wide variety of patterns.  Sometimes there are wide gaps, other times the events are tightly clustered, occasionally they are more evenly spread out."

    "\n",
    "The first is the duration of the flash.  Experimental results show that if we have a shorter flash with the same number of photons, we have the same probability of detecting it.  This makes sense because they could all arrive simultaneously (but at different rhodopsin molecules) and would still be detected.  This doesn't hold if we make the flash too long (> ~200 ms) -- the photons will be too spread out, the resulting currents in the retinal circuitry wouldn't sum, and we wouldn't see it.  Thus, it makes sense to talk about the intensity of the flash in terms of the total number of photons without needing to specify the duration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second is that only a fraction of the photons arriving at the eye are actually detected by rods.  Some are scattered, some are absorbed, some pass through the retina without being detected. Measurements in original paper by Hecht, Shlaer, and Pirenne (1942) (HSP) estimated that 4% of the incident photons are reflected by the cornea, 50% are absorbed by the lens and other ocular media, and at least 80% passes through the retina without being absorbed.  Overall, Hecht et al estimated that, for a typical flash, the range of 54 to 148 photons that arrive at the cornea, only 5 to 14 are actually absorbed by retinal rods."
