    "\n",
    "When working with sounds, however, it is often more convenient to think of a sine wave as having a time delay that is specified in seconds.  Write a function `sinewave(t; f=1.0, d=0.0)` that has arguments of `t` for the time value, `f` for the frequency, and `d` for the delay in seconds, with default values for the frequency and delay. Note that delay refers to a delay in the signal, i.e. a signal that normally starts at a time of 0 seconds with a delay `d = 0.01` would now start to +10 millseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays of time values for a given sampling frequency should be defined *outside* the function.  A vector version of the function (if you are not using broadcasting) should accept an array of time values and return an array of function values at those times.  These conventions also apply to the functions below.\n",

These are real-valued, and describe the time points at the centers of the sample periods. And 3) the index of the array."

    "\n",
    "A **Gabor function** is a sinusoid modulated by a Gaussian.  It is used to describe a filter that is localized in both time and frequency or, for a spatial signal like an image, position and spatial frequency.  We will see later that 2D Gabor functions arise is the context of efficient visual representations.  Remarkably, the filtering and representation properties of the early visual system are described quite accurately with Gabor functions.  Gabor-like features commonly emerge in the first layers of neural networks when trained on general visual tasks.\n",

    "$\\sigma$ is the Gaussian width (or standard deviation) which is usually a small (integer) number of sinusoid periods.  The frequency $f$ is in Hertz for temporal signals.  For spatial signals, it is often convenient to define the sinusoid in terms of the period in pixels or samples, e.g. 1 period per 8 pixels.  The phase is in radians and is usually restricted to 0 or $\\pi/2$ to give **even** and **odd** versions of the Gabor function (`gabore` and `gaboro`, which you should also define).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalar function definitions (for a scalar value of `t`) do not need to be normalized (since it depends on the sampling frequency), but they should accept the normalizing constant `a`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the scalar function *could* be computed (given the sampling frequency), but this would be very inefficient.  Instead, define functions `gabor_norm`, `gabore_norm`, and `gaboro_norm` to compute the normalization constant.  These should accept the same arguments as the scalar functions, but without a time argument and have an additional argument for the sampling frequency.  The normalization constants should be computed using the non-zero extents of the functions.\n",
